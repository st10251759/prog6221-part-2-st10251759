# Recipe Management Console Application

## Description
This project is a console application for managing recipes, allowing users to enter recipe details, including ingredients and steps, and providing functionalities to scale, reset, clear recipes, and calculate total calories. The application also alerts users when the total calories exceed 300.

The application demonstrates the use of object-oriented programming concepts in C# to create a user-friendly interface for managing recipes. It utilizes generic collections and delegates, with comprehensive comments included to explain the code.

## Installation
To run the application, follow these steps:
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the project in Visual Studio.
3. Build the project to restore dependencies.
4. Run the application.

## Feedback Implementation
I obtained 100% and required no implemented feedback. All work done was to address the requirements of PART 2 ONLY, and there is NO FEEDBACK to implement for part 1.  

## Usage
1. Enter the details for a new recipe, including name, ingredients, and steps.
2. Select an option from the menu:
   - **Display Recipe**: View the recipe details.
   - **Scale Recipe**: Adjust the quantities of ingredients based on a scaling factor (0.5, 2, 3).
   - **Reset Recipe**: Reset ingredient quantities to their original values.
   - **Clear**: Clear the current recipe and enter a new one.
   - **Add a Recipe**: Add a new recipe.
   - **Display All Recipes**: View all entered recipes in alphabetical order.
   - **Back to Main Menu**: Return to the main menu.
   - **Exit**: Exit the application.

## Future Features
- Add support for saving and loading recipes from a file.
- Implement a search functionality to find recipes by name or ingredients.
- Improve the user interface with colors and formatting.
- Transition to a graphical user interface (GUI) using Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF) or Universal Windows Platform (UWP).
  - Allow filtering recipes by ingredient, food group, or maximum calories.
  - Enable creating a menu with multiple recipes and display a pie chart showing the percentage of each food group in the total menu.

## Learning Outcomes
By the end of this project, students should be able to:
- Use Extensible Application Markup Language (XAML) to create graphical user interfaces.
- Utilize controls to build a graphical user interface.
- Implement graphics rendering services to display graphical views of data.
- Apply styles in a user interface.

### Future Development Goals
In the final phase of this project, you will update the application to include a graphical user interface (GUI) using either WPF or UWP. All functionalities from the command-line application must be preserved and presented in a more user-friendly way. Additionally, one of the following features should be added:
1. Filter recipes by:
   - Ingredient name,
   - Food group, or
   - Maximum calories.
2. Create a menu with multiple recipes and display a pie chart showing the percentage of each food group in the total menu.
